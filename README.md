# lore-wiki

<p>
  lore.wiki was quite the ambitious project with what was at the time too much scope, the layout I had in mind was something like discord but instead of discord servers you'd have all these entries of documentation across all sorts of things.
</p>
<p>
  At the time my skill-set really wasn't up to the task and my code was rather messy and lacking compared to my current standards.
</p>
<p>
  maybe I'll revisit this project one day but for now I'm making it public and archiving it.
